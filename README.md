To-Do List:
Finalize Smart Contract:

 Implement a minting function that requires a tokenURI for each new fish NFT.
 Add a function to track and update fish metadata (e.g., RFID, breeding info).
 Integrate transfer functionality to handle NFT ownership changes.
NFT Metadata Structure:

 Determine the structure for the fish metadata. For example, use IPFS to store fish image and associated details (RFID, breeding history, contests, etc.).
 Create a way to automatically generate or validate this metadata to reduce the risk of manipulation.
Verification Mechanism:

 Implement a third-party verifier or DAO governance system for validating ownership, RFID authenticity, and breeding data.
 Develop a reputation system to incentivize reliable validators.
Security Measures:

 Set up a secure authentication system to prevent unauthorized changes to the fishâ€™s data.
 Ensure that RFID data and fish images are encrypted or hashed to prevent tampering.
Integration with RFID:

 Develop a system for linking the RFID tag of the fish to its NFT, ensuring the physical fish is correctly identified in the blockchain.
User Interface (Optional):

 Build a simple dApp or Web Interface where users can interact with the fish NFTs, view metadata, and initiate transfers.
 Include functionality for users to upload new fish data or make changes to metadata (if applicable).
Testing and Deployment:

 Test the entire system for bugs, especially the minting, transfer, and metadata retrieval functions.
 Deploy the contract on testnet (like Rinkeby or Goerli) before going live on Ethereum mainnet.
 Ensure that the contract adheres to best practices (e.g., security audits, gas optimization).
